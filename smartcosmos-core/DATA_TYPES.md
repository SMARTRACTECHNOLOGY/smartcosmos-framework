# SnapBundle™ Data Types
The SnapBundle™ platform consists of three distinct categories of data types:

* [Primary](#primary)
* [Secondary](#secondary)

The **Primary** types (both foundational and supporting) exist on their own. 

The **Secondary** types cannot exist on their own. In object oriented parlance, they cannot be an _is-a_ and are relegated to being composed inside of a primary type.


## [Primary Types](id:primary)
The SnapBundle™ object model consists of a small number of primary data types. A primary data type is a _first class citizen_ in the SnapBundle™ platform. These types have the ability to stand on their own. Primary types are sub-categorized as _foundational_ or _supporting_. Again, all primary types can stand on their own. The primary types include:

### Foundational
* [Object](OBJECT.md "Object")
* [Relationship](RELATIONSHIP.md "Relationship]")
* [Object Interaction](OBJECT_INTERACTION.md "ObjectInteraction")

### Supporting
* [User](USER.md "User")
* [Device](DEVICE.md "Device")
* [File](FILE.md "File")
* [GeoRectification](GEORECTIFICATION.MD "GeoRectification")

There is no physical limitation on how many instances can be created, though additional service fees may be applied to your account based on your subscription plan.

## [Secondary Types](id:secondary)
Each of the data types defined in this section are secondary types that are entirely contained within a primary data type or directly refer to a pre-existing primary data type entity; they cannot stand on their own. For example, `SecurityRole` is _not_ a primary data type; it only exists within the context of a User primary data type. Similarly, an `ObjectAddress`  is _not_ a primary data type because it must be associated with an existing `Obect` at creation time. (In OO parlance, an Object "has-a" Object Address)

* [EntityReferenceType](#ert)
* [Object Address](OBJECT_ADDRESS.md "ObjectAddress")
* [Metadata](METADATA.md "Metadata")
* [Tag](TAG.md "Tag")
* [RoleType](#rt)
* [MetadataDataType](#mdt)
* [LicenseType](#lt)
* [PermissionType](#pt)
* [EventType](#et)

### [EntityReferenceType](id:ert)
An Entity Reference Type is used to provide context to a type-agnositc call, such as a search operation.  

* Account
* Extension
* NotificationEndpoint
* Object
* Relationship
* ObjectInteraction
* ObjectInteractionSession
* Device
* ObjectAddress
* File
* Metadata
* Tag
* Timeline
* Georectification
  
### [RoleType](id:rt)
Security roles are associated with a User and define the privilege levels for the User when interacting with the SnapBundle™ platform.

* Administrator
* Developer
* User

### [MetadataDataType](id:mdt)
Metadata Data Types are used to refine a key-value pair into a type-safe key-value pair.

* StringType
* DateType
* IntegerType
* LongType
* BooleanType
* FloatType
* DoubleType
* JSONType
* XMLType
* Custom

The `JSONType` and `XMLType` are convenient mechanism for storing structured metadata under a given metadata key. The platform persists all of the types _except_ for Custom using well-known byte[] formats. As described by the [Metadata](METADATA.md "Metadata") definition, there are well-known **public/** endpoints to ensure that the proper byte[] encoding is easily obtained. 

> If an entirely proprietary encoding scheme is required, use the `Custom` MetadataDataType.

### [PermissionType](id:pt)
Every Extension must explicitly declare a set of permissions that it is requesting from a User. 

* AccountRead
* AccountWrite
* DeviceRead
* DeviceWrite
* FileRead
* FileWrite
* GeospatialEntryRead
* GeospatialEntryWrite
* MetadataRead
* MetadataWrite
* ObjectRead
* ObjectWrite
* ObjectAddressRead
* ObjectAddressWrite
* ObjectInteractionRead
* ObjectInteractionWrite
* ObjectInteractionSessionRead
* ObjectInteractionSessionWrite
* RelationshipRead
* RelationshipWrite
* TagAssignmentRead
* TagAssignmentWrite
* TagRead
* TagWrite
* TimelineRead
* TimelineWrite
* UserRead
* UserWrite
* EventStream[^1]

[^1]: Implies all *Read permissions are assigned since object JSON is included in all events


### [EventType](id:et)
The following is meant to be an authoritative list of all known event types generated by the current (v1) version of the SnapBundle™ platform. These events are intended to be machine readable for easy parsing; their case is presented accurately below to match what will be included in the actual Event dispatched to the Extension's integration end point.
