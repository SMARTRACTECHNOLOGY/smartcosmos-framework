/**
 * <b>EXPERIMENTAL PACKAGE - NO PRODUCTION SUPPORT</b>
 *
 * Defines a plugin metaphor whereby 3rd party developers can tap into an
 * account's contextual data in order to perform advanced computations that
 * are not natively supported by the SMART COSMOS Objects platform. The primary means
 * of near real-time integration with these external components is via an
 * {@link net.smartcosmos.model.event.EventType} notification delivered to
 * an {@link net.smartcosmos.model.integration.INotificationEndpoint} managed
 * by the extension.
