/**
 * Objects may be associated with 0, 1, or many different addresses. If a {@link IObject} defines a
 * {@link #Permanent} address, then it must only define a single address, and that address will support an update
 * operation. If the {@link IObject} defines a {@link #LastKnown} address, then the address is immediately immutable
 * and cannot be updated. Unlike a {@link IObject} with a {@link #Permanent} address, any {@link IObject} using a
 * {@link #LastKnown} address strategy may have an unlimited number of immutable last known address entries.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link #Permanent} address is typically assigned to items that are fixed in position, such as a building or
 * a permanently installed piece of equipment like a large printing press. The {@link #LastKnown} address strategy is
 * typically used for tracking items that move around frequently. For example, a test tube used in a pharmaceutical
 * trial may be collected in one location, analyzed in another, and stored for a period of time in several other
 * locations.
