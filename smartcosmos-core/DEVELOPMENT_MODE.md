# Developer Mode

## Toggle Development License
Any Account may choose to activate (or deactivate) a development license at anytime. Activating a Development License is only necessary if the Account is going to actively develop an **SnapBundleâ„¢ Extension**. Short of this, there is no reason to access these endpoints.
