# ObjectInteractionSession

**NOTE:** Only Enterprise licensees have access to object interaction sessions. 

The object Interaction Session is used to logically batch together a collection of Object Interactions. An Object Interaction Session is, for all intents and purposes, a logical grouping construct with a start time and a stop time. This logical grouping construct conveys that an entire set of Object Interactions occurred within the context of a single unit of work; somehow, all of these Object Interactions are related. The specifics of the relationship are not inferred by the SnapBundleâ„¢ platform; it is an external concept. However, the general use case is built around the concept of reading numerous UHF RFID tags with a specialized RFID scanner.

## SessionType
The session type is used as a high level categorization to describe how the object interaction set represented by the session was assembled. The _Unknown_ enumeration is generally used strictly as a decorator to indicate a non-batch collection occurred.
