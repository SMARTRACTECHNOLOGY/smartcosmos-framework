The authoritative documentation can be found at [http://docs.snapbundle.apiary.io](http://docs.snapbundle.apiary.io "SnapBundle at apiary").

### Extension Architecture
The SnapBundle platform was designed from scratch with a plugin model; we call them *extensions*. Remember how we said
that we aren't an analytical engine? We aren't, but maybe you are. Use any modern language- Python, Ruby, Java, .NET, or
anything that can talk to us using HTTP and JSON. We built our authorization model around the
[OAuth 2.0 Specification (RFC 6749)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749 "OAuth 2.0 Specification"), and data owners can
grant you read or write access in a very granular fashion.
