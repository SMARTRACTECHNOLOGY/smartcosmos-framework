> **__Context is Everything__ (SM)**

## Overview
You know those car commercials that satirize the differences between **_and_** and **_or_** in various situations? One commercial starts with a couple in a car discussing style **_and_** high gas mileage. They are laughing about if they only had **_or_**, like "nuts **_or_** bolts." A dream sequence kicks in, and the couple is now standing in front of a huge pool with kids swimming.  The husband looks at his wife and asks innocently "I wonder what all these nuts are for?" Moments later, the whole pool comes apart and a flood of water engulfs everyone. The dream sequence ends, returning back to the couple driving in their hybrid car, excited that they get style **_and_** high gas mileage.  


> Would you rather have a serial number, e.g. a car vehicle identification number (VIN), **_or_** media-rich context, or a VIN **_and_** media-rich context? The SnapBundle™ Platform gives you **_and_** capabilities!

## Your App _and_ SnapBundle™
Your app is great. SnapBundle™ will help you make it better. We recognize that you've got paying customers, great reviews in the app store, and a pipeline full of leads. Ask yourself this critical question: Are you a _one hit wonder_ with your customers, or do you incentize them with additional capabilities where they want to come back _and_ give you more money for more capabilities? It's this little known concept called **_Cross-Sell/Up-Sell_** in business parlance. Using SnapBundle™ can increase the _total lifetime value of a customer_, a key business metric. By combining your app _and_ SnapBundle™, you create a cross-sell/up-sell opportunity. Everyone likes more money, right?

The SnapBundle™ platform was built with these core tenets in mind:

### Tag Everything.
SnapBundle™ works with _any_ type of object that has either an assigned serial number or a made-up serial number (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) that is unique to your Account. Thus, the platform works equally well with barcodes, QR-codes, RFID & NFC tags as it does with plain old serial numbers. If it has a unique serial number, or you can make something up, it can be defined as an [Object](OBJECT.md "Object") in our system, and every Object provides a plethora of media-rich contextual association opportunities.

### Create Rich Associations.
SnapBundle™ can easily associate virtually _anything_ with _anything_. Hashtags, key-value metadata, and arbitrary files of any type or size is easily associated with an Object and securely stored in the Cloud. Contextual search capabilities mean you can find matching Objects by looking for keywords instead of long, boring serial numbers. Check out our [primary data types](DATA_TYPES.md "Primary Data Types") to see our incredibly intuitive object model.

### Near Real-Time Integrations
We get it- *you* generated the data, *you* want to own the data, and, you want us to push it to you in a timely manner. That's exactly what the SnapBundle™ platform can do. Define a standard HTTPS end point in your data center, and as soon as we digitally sign and persist the data, we'll push a copy of the data to you using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as fast as the ether will carry the bits. Check out our [Event Stream](EVENT.md "Event Stream") model to see how easy it is to understand the data feed.

### No Expensive Hardware.
The SnapBundle™ platform is optimized for today's smart phones and tablets. Use your device’s camera to scan a barcode and QR-codes, or your device’s NFC capabilities to scan tags. Or, if you just want to link documents to serial numbers then use your favorite keyboard and Web browser.
