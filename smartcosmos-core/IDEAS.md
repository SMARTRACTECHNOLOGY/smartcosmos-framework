#SnapBundle™ Idea Book

## Compliment Existing Systems
* Use the Google APIs to create rich associations between Google Apps documents and supporting evidence. For example, write a term paper and link the paper to all of the research documentations, tagged and searchable, within the SnapBundle™ platform.
* Integrate with an existing preventative management system where the equipment already has asset tags. Usse the serial number of the asset tags to create Object instances and link photos, videos, tags, the user(s) that performed the PM work, etc. 

## Mashups
* Hook up Twitter and Facebook to SnapBundle™ to create virtual scrapbooks around certain events. Send the best pictures up to Twitter, but store the dozens of others, linked to the tweet, on SnapBundle™.
