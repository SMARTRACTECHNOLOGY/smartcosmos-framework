# SMART COSMOS developer and single-node (non-HA) relies on an embedded LDAP directory server for managing user
# authentication. When the directoryService is defined as net.smartcosmos.platform.service.directory.EmbeddedLdapService
# then the embedded LDAP directory server MUST BE ENABLED. If, however, this configuration is going to be used in an
# Highly Available (HA) topology behind a load balancer, then the EmbeddedLdapService is not a viable service class
# since it doesn't provide HA support. In this case, enabled should be false, and a different directoryService should
# be defined in this configuration file.
