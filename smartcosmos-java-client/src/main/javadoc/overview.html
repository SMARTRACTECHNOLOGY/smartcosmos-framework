<br>
SMART COSMOS&trade; is an RFID-centric platform purposefully built to be an application's contextual data store, and <b>if you are
    developing a solution that is either not Java based or you'd simply prefer to operate using standard JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) and REST web service calls</b>, please refer to the public REST endpoint documentation at
<a href="http://docs.smartcosmosobjects.apiary.io">http://docs.smartcosmosobjects.apiary.io</a>.

<h2>Entity Clients</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
Entity clients are Java classes that are intended to fully encapsulate and hide the RESTful architecture of the platform
from the developer. They were built in such a way to reduce the underlying transport (REST calls over HTTP/S) and
its HTTP status codes to an afterthought. Instead of worrying about the subtleties of a 200, 201, 204, or 409 HTTP
status code, the developer just looks at a boolean value, the size of a collection, or interprets a simple and easy to
use <code>ResponseEntity</code> that contains a <code>Result</code> code that can be <code>switch</code>ed.

<h3>Usage</h3>
The general pattern is the same for every single SMART COSMOS entity client:
<pre>
    // Define your server context
    ServerContext context = new ServerContext(USERNAME, PASSWORD);
    // Create an instance of your target entity client
    ISpecificClient client = SpecificClientFactory.createClient(serverContext);
    // Do something with the client
    client.doSomething();
</pre>
The following provides a realistic example of using the IObjectClient to locate a specific entity instance, update its
properties, and then save those changes back to the cloud:
<pre>
    //Define a server context that will connect to the default platform endpoint with the specified username, password.
    ServerContext context = new ServerContext(USERNAME, PASSWORD);

    //Create an instance of an IObject client using the server context
    IObjectClient client = ObjectFactory.createClient(context);

    //Use one of the search methods to find a very specific IObject instance
    IObject entity = client.findByExactObjectUrn(YOUR_ARBITRARY_OBJECT_URN);

    // Update the name and moniker values of the object
    entity.setName("Updated RFID Tag Name");
    entity.setMoniker("foo-moniker");

    // Save those changes back to the cloud
    client.update(entity);
</pre>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
The <b>entire</b> SMART COSMOS platform has been mapped back to the client interfaces defined in this library. From
account registration to user managements, the client interfaces in this library literally represent 100% of the current
capabilities of the platform.
