/**
 * <b>GO AWAY</b> non-public implementation package that developers should avoid for all intents and purposes.
 * It defines a collection of RESTful endpoints for each SnapBundle entity type, and includes a set of parameterized
 * URLs to ensure that the client classes in this library are using the correct number of parameters when constructing
 * their REST endpoint URL.
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b> While this package is considered private, the endpoints defined herein are explicitly public and fully
 * documented.
